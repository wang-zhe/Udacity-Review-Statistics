    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "***************\n",
    "Choice 1: Decision Trees\n",
    "Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "A decision tree can be applied to recommendation of apps for users.  We worked through several examples of this in the videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "First, decision trees are very easily interpretted by non-technical people.  So the message translates well. They also tend to mirror human decision making more closely than many other models (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning). They perform well on large sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "Decision trees are not very robust and small changes in the training model can lead to changes in the final decision. They also tend to overfit the data. They may perform poorly if a categorical feature has a high number of levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "We have a large data set that has a limited number of levels for each feature. Our data also consists of numeric and categorical variables and the decision tree should be able to manage both types.\n",
    "\n",
    "***************\n",
    "Choice 2: Ensemble Methods: Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "Random forests can be applied to a classification problems similar to decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "The strengths of this model is that it essentially creates many decision trees and returns the values that occur most throughout the analysis as the prediction. They tend to be better at preventing overfitting than decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "One weakness of random forests is that we are applying a \"black box\" approach to the decision trees.  We have no control over which features are being used to construct the \"forests\". Therefore, they are somewhat difficult to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "A random forest will handle the categorical variables in the data well, and will help control some overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "***************\n",
    "Choice 3: Ensemble Methods: AdaBoost\n",
    "Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "Adaboost has been applied to help with facial recognition (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/05/boosting-algorithms-simplified/).\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "One strength is that there aren't many parameters that require tuning. It is able to accurately capture complex classification boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "Adaboost has been shown to be vulnerable to uniform noise (http://math.mit.edu/~rothvoss/18.304.3PM/Presentations/1-Eric-Boosting304FinalRpdf.pdf).  This model also tends to run slower than decision trees and random forests, but we can hope the time we be a trade off for prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "The model seems to be something that is not going to be run very often, maybe once or twice a year.  So despite the excessive time consumption, I feel it will be a good model to implement with this data.\n"

    "The adaboost combines several weak learners in order to build a strong learner.  A weak learner is a basic classification line, such as a one-node decision tree (which only has 1 line, values on one side are pass, values on the other side are fail). The adaboost will then assign values to the misclassified points, which ultimately serve as weights.  So we punish the model for missing the misclassified points.  We then run another weak learner against the newly weighted values.  This new learner will try harder to correctly classify these heavier weighted points.  We again assign larger weights to the misclassified points and run another weak learner against it using the combined weight up to this point. Ultimately, we repeat this method until we have identified a strong learner that fits the data well."

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!"

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "In my mind there is a tie for the most important, and those features would be education and education-num.  The problem is that these variables are dependent on one another so neither one will give us more value than the other.  I do feel that education level is a strong indicator of the income level of an individual. Let's consider this only one variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe the next strongest feature would be occupation.  It is very plausible that someone who is identifies as an 'Exec-managerial' will earn more than someone who is identified as 'Farming-fishing', on average.\n",

    "I believe the third most important feature would be the workclass. There are some clear indicators here that would point to an income <=50K, such as 'Never-worker'.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature that I would consider as the fourth most important would be sex. Unfortunately, it is a known fact that a gender earnings gap exists. This may be valuable to us in building a model; however, I would be very curious to investigate which gender is more likely to make a donation, men or women?\n",
    "\n",
    "The last feature I find most important for prediction would be native-country.  Some of these countries may be considered third world countries and it is reasonable to assume that some people left their native country to pursue a life in the U.S. where they may be entering the unskilled workforce. This isn't true for all who migrate to the U.S., however, I feel this may be a good predictor."

    "I was way off!!  I was correct with education-num being the highest predictor, but I missed the remaining four.  I could see why hour-per-week is important.  If a person is an hourly worker, high hours could lead to higher income.  I feel I overlooked that aspect because I am salaried.  Capital-gain makes sense too, generally this would be a high value but I thought it was a one-time occurrence, which made me avoid this variable.  Age, I was on the fence about.  Younger people tend to earn less. Capital-loss follows a similar logic to capital-gain.  Except, someone who experiences high capital-loss would be more likely to fall below the 50K threshold (I think)."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
